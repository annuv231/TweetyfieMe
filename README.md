*To load an unpacked extension in developer mode:*

- Go to the Extensions page by entering `chrome://extensions` in a new tab. (By design `chrome:// URLs` are not linkable.)

- Alternatively, click on the Extensions menu puzzle button and select Manage Extensions at the bottom of the menu.


- Or, click the Chrome menu, hover over More Tools, then select Extensions.
Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to Developer mode.

- Click the Load unpacked button and select the extension directory.
